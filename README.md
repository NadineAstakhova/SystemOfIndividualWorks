# System Of Individual Works

<p>Web application based on the MVC-model using the PHP-framework Yii2. Besides using JS, HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap.

<p>This web application works with database (MySQL).

<p>The main objective of the project - to systematize work files sent by students. The convenient feature - Filename pattern "Subject_Task_Student".
<p>In addition, web application provides information about the groups, the statistics of work and their evaluation.
<p>Using media-queries, the site is adaptive for any device.
<p>An interesting point of development - identification class of the user can only be one, as the table in the database, but we have two completely different users. With the use of more tables in the database and sessions in Yii is able to get around.

<p>The project is still being developed, so it isn't latest version.

<p>P.S. There is a second version of the System with another design and additional functionality. Now this system is being tested (beta-test).
